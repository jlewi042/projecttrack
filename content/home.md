# ProjectTrack: DoD Contract Proposal Assistant

## Overview

ProjectTrack is a comprehensive solution that assists with writing proposals for winning DoD contracts. It identifies opportunities based on how new Performance Work Statements (PWS) align with past work and past PWS documents.

Using generative AI and access to past performance documents (including proposals, awards, CPAR scores, PWS's, and Technical Instructions), ProjectTrack streamlines the proposal development process and maximizes win probability.

## Key Features

- **Document Comparison**: Analyze alignment between new PWS and legacy PWS documents
- **Opportunity Scoring**: Evaluate potential opportunities based on past performance
- **Automated Content Generation**: Create PWS Crosswalk Tables, Relevancy Grids, and Story Blocks
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify strengths and weaknesses in past performance coverage
- **Compliance Assurance**: Ensure adherence to DoD proposal requirements and standards

## Core Deliverables

1. **PWS Crosswalk Tables** with Green/Yellow/Red relevancy color codes
2. **Relevancy Grids** for each reference contract
3. **Story Blocks** following Challenge-Action-Result format
4. **Assembled Past-Performance Volumes**
5. **Questions Lists** for strengthening weak areas

## Benefits

- Improved proposal quality and compliance
- Reduced proposal development time
- Enhanced opportunity identification
- Better utilization of past performance
- Increased win probability
