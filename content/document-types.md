# Document Types Analysis

ProjectTrack processes and analyzes various types of past performance documents to extract relevant information for proposal development.

## Performance Work Statements (PWS)

- **Description**: Detailed descriptions of work requirements for government contracts
- **Key Elements**: Scope, objectives, tasks, deliverables, performance standards
- **Usage in Agent**: Primary document for comparison between new opportunities and past work
- **AI Processing Needs**: 
  - Section extraction and categorization
  - Requirement identification and classification
  - Technical terminology extraction
  - Similarity matching between new and legacy PWS sections

## Technical Instructions (TI)

- **Description**: Specific technical requirements and instructions for contract execution
- **Key Elements**: Technical specifications, methodologies, standards, acceptance criteria
- **Usage in Agent**: Supporting document for technical capability alignment
- **AI Processing Needs**:
  - Technical requirement extraction
  - Capability matching
  - Technical terminology standardization

## Past Proposals

- **Description**: Previously submitted proposals for government contracts
- **Key Elements**: Executive summaries, technical approaches, management approaches, past performance references
- **Usage in Agent**: Source for reusable content and successful proposal structures
- **AI Processing Needs**:
  - Section classification
  - Success pattern identification
  - Content extraction for story blocks
  - Formatting and structure analysis

## Contract Awards

- **Description**: Documentation of awarded contracts
- **Key Elements**: Contract values, periods of performance, awarded scope
- **Usage in Agent**: Verification of past performance claims and contract details
- **AI Processing Needs**:
  - Contract detail extraction (value, dates, scope)
  - Agency and customer information extraction
  - Contract type classification

## CPAR Scores and Evaluations

- **Description**: Contractor Performance Assessment Reports providing formal evaluations
- **Key Elements**: Performance ratings, evaluator comments, improvement areas, strengths
- **Usage in Agent**: Evidence for past performance quality and customer satisfaction
- **AI Processing Needs**:
  - Rating extraction and normalization
  - Positive comment identification
  - Strength/weakness classification
  - Quote extraction for proposal inclusion

## Relevancy Matrices

- **Description**: Internal or previous assessments of contract relevance to new opportunities
- **Key Elements**: Scope, magnitude, complexity, and customer-type ratings
- **Usage in Agent**: Template and historical data for new relevancy assessments
- **AI Processing Needs**:
  - Rating extraction and standardization
  - Dimension mapping (scope, magnitude, complexity, customer-type)
  - Historical pattern recognition

## PWS Crosswalk Tables

- **Description**: Previous comparison tables between new and legacy PWS documents
- **Key Elements**: Section mappings, relevancy ratings, evidence snippets
- **Usage in Agent**: Templates and historical data for new crosswalk tables
- **AI Processing Needs**:
  - Table structure recognition
  - Color coding interpretation
  - Evidence extraction and classification

## Story Blocks

- **Description**: Narrative descriptions of past performance following Challenge-Action-Result format
- **Key Elements**: Challenge descriptions, actions taken, results achieved, tie-back statements
- **Usage in Agent**: Templates and content for new story blocks
- **AI Processing Needs**:
  - Narrative structure recognition
  - C-A-R component classification
  - Metric extraction
  - Length and formatting compliance checking
